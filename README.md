# Introduction to React Native

## Brief

Learners have acquired knowledge and skills on React JS in module 2. In this module, we are leveraging transferrable knowledge from React such as components, props, states, lifecycles and such to React Native. React JS compiles components to DOM. React Native compiles components to native mobile components.
